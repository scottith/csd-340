        <h2>Chapter 1: My Story</h2>

        <p class="intro" id="paragraph1">
            I grew up on the southside of Columbus and moved out to Pataskala when I was 7 years old. I have traveled a bit but have
			been here ever since. I currently work as a Systems Administrator for Kohl's right here in Pataskala, Ohio.
			I have been with Kohl's for over 4 years now and they've gave me the ability to pursue a degree.
            <span class="sentence">My love for technology started when I first used a computer in elementary school.</span>
        </p>

        <p id="paragraph2">
            Over the years, I developed a deep passion for video games. 
            I also enjoy reading books but most importantly, being a father.
            These hobbies allow me to express myself creatively and unwind after a long day.
        </p>

        <p id="paragraph3">
            I have a wonderful family that has always supported me in my academic and professional pursuits. 
            We enjoy taking trips together, especially to national parks. 
            Our time together has taught me the value of patience, empathy, and hard work.
        </p>

        <p id="paragraph4">
            In my spare time, I enjoy experimenting with code, learning new software tools, and gaming with friends. 
            I'm currently pursuing a degree in software development, which combines my logical and creative interests. 
            My long-term goal is to work remotely in a tech-related field and build applications that make a difference.
